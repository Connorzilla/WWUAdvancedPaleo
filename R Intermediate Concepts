##SECTION 1 QUESTIONS
1. #### What does the replace = argument of the sample( ) function do?

The replace = argument gives the items in the list a hidden numeric value. 

2. #### Using as(MyMatrix,"numeric") will not convert MyMatrix to a numeric data! Can you use another property of logicals other than as( ) that will convert the logicals of MyMatrix to 0's and 1's?

Yes, using the function: 
MyMatrix[which(MyMatrix==TRUE)]<-1

3. #### If you wanted to check if all the elements in each row are true, how would you do this?

Use the 'which' and 'apply' functions on dimension 1 (rows) and find which one sums to all 'TRUE' values with the function:
> which(apply(MyMatrix,1,sum)==TRUE)
integer(0)

##SECTION 2 QUESTIONS
4. #### How many times does the number 7 occur in MyMatrix?



5. #### How do you find the sum of each column?



6. #### How do you find the product of each column?



7. #### How can you change every instance of the number 1 to 11?



8. #### How many values in MyMatrix are greater than 3 and less than 8?



9. #### How can you change the elements of column 12 into character data, while keeping columns 1-11 as numeric data?



10. #### Find which rows of MyMatrix have a sum >70. Make a new version of MyMatrix where the 13th column is a set of TRUE and FALSE values denoting which rows have a sum >70. (Hint: What type of object allows you to store both logical and numeric data at once?)
