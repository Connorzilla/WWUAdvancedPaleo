### Morphometric Plot of Osteostracans

Unfortunately the plot won't embed, but if you look at my repository for it, you'll see that there's quite a spread in terms of feature placement for the osteostracans. The plot shows that the 'wing'-like features are the most varied between members, but there's also substantial diversity in terms of specimen length. 

### PCA Plot

The PCA plot and summaries describe how individual specimens vary from the mean of all osteostracans, like the morphometric plot but more useful when looking at individuals apart from the group. 

For example, according to the plot, individuals 29 and 8 are least alike in terms of principal component 1. This aspect of the morphology seems to be how long the specimen was from head to rear. Specimen 8 was very short wheras specimen 29 was long in build.
